        <h3>Taste the crispiest chicken schnitzel you have ever tried</h3>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Falvourless oil, for deep-frying</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, lightly beaten with 2 tablespoons water </li>
            <li>3 cups panko breadcrumbs </li>
            <li>2 teaspoons sweet paprika </li>
            <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper </li>
            <li>6 boneless, skinless chicken breasts </li>
            <li>Lemon wedges, for serving </li>
        </ul>
       
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Pour 1 1/2 inches of oil into a large heavy pot or high-sided skillet. Clip on a deep-fry thermometer and heat the oil over medium-high heat to 360 degrees F.</li>
            <li>Set up a dredging station: Place the flour, eggs, and breadcrumbs in each of 3 separate bowls. Season the breadcrumbs with the paprika, 1 teaspoon salt and a few turns of pepper.</li>
            <li>Place a piece of chicken between 2 large pieces of plastic wrap and use a rolling pin or other blunt object to pound the chicken until it is as thin as you can make it without it tearing. Repeat with the remaining chicken.</li>
            <li>Coat the chicken first in the flour, then in the egg wash and finally in the breadcrumbs. Fry in batches, flipping once, until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack set over a baking sheet to drain; season both sides with salt and pepper. Hold in a warm oven if not serving immediately. Serve with lemon wedges.</li>
